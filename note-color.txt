Ah, I see! Here are some suggestions for where to use the colors I recommended:

1. Primary Color (#0078D4): Use this color for the main headers, titles, and buttons on your website. You can also use it for accents or call-to-action elements.

2. Secondary Color (#4CAF50): Use this color for subheadings, icons, or other graphical elements. You can also use it to highlight certain features or benefits of your file-sharing platform.

3. Background Color (#F5F5F5): Use this color for the main background of your website. It provides a clean and neutral background that makes the other colors stand out.

4. Accent Color (#FFC107): Use this color for smaller accents, such as highlights or borders. It adds energy and creativity to your design and can help draw attention to important elements.

Remember that these are just suggestions, and you can adjust the colors and their usage to fit your branding and design needs.
